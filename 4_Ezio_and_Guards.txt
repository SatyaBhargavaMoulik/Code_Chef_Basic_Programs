Problem :
======
	Ezio can manipulate at most X number of guards with the apple of eden.
	Given that there are Y number of guards, predict if he can safely manipulate all of them.

Input :									
=====								

	First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
	Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers X and Y.
	3
	5 7
	6 6
	9 1

Output :
======
	NO
	YES
	YES

	Test Case 1:	 Ezio can manipulate at most 5 guards. Since there are 7 guards, he cannot manipulate all of them.
	-------------
	Test Case 2 :  	Ezio can manipulate at most 6 guards. Since there are 6 guards, he can manipulate all of them.

	Test Case 3 :	Ezio can manipulate at most 9 guards. Since there is only 1 guard, he can manipulate the guard

Code : 
====
using System;

public class Test
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		int no_of_test_cases,x,y;
		no_of_test_cases=Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
		for(int i=1;i<=no_of_test_cases;i++)
		{
		    string[] inputs=Console.ReadLine().Split(' ');
		    x=Convert.ToInt32(inputs[0]);
		    y=Convert.ToInt32(inputs[1]);
		    if(x>=y)
		    {
		        Console.WriteLine("YES");
		    }
		    else
		    {
		        Console.WriteLine("NO");
		    }
		}
	}
}
