Problem : 
======
	Chef has N empty bottles where each bottle has a capacity of X litres.
	There is a water tank in Chefland having K litres of water. Chef wants to fill the empty bottles using the water in the tank.
	Assuming that Chef does not spill any water while filling the bottles, find out the maximum number of bottles Chef can fill completely.


Input Format :
=========
	First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
	Each test case contains of a single line of input, three integers N,X, and K.


Input :									Output : 				
====									=====
	3
	5 2 8		-	-	-	-	-	-	->	4
	10 5 4	-	-	-	-	-	-	->	0
	3 1 4		- 	-	-	-	-	-	->	3

Test case Explaination :
===============
Test Case 1: The amount of water in the tank is 8 litres. The capacity of each bottle is 2 litres. Hence, 4 water bottles can be filled completely.

Test Case 2: The amount of water in the tank is 4 litres. The capacity of each bottle is 5 litres. Hence, no water bottle can be filled completely.

Test Case 3: The amount of water in the tank is 4 litres. The capacity of each bottle is 1 litre. Chef has 3 bottles available. He can fill all these bottles 
		   completely using 3 litres of water.

Coding Approach:
============
using System;
public class Test
{
	public static void Main()
	{ 
		int no_of_test_cases,no_of_bottles,capacity_of_each_bottle,water_quantity,maximum_no_of_bottles_filled;
		no_of_test_cases=Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
		for(int i=1;i<=no_of_test_cases;i++)
		{
		    //taking input and storing in string array	
		    string[] inputs=Console.ReadLine().Split(' ');
		
		    // Accessing items in string array and converting them into integer and assigning them to respective variables
		    no_of_bottles=Convert.ToInt32(inputs[0]);
		    capacity_of_each_bottle=Convert.ToInt32(inputs[1]);
		    water_quantity=Convert.ToInt32(inputs[2]);
		    
		    maximum_no_of_bottles_filled = water_quantity / capacity_of_each_bottle;
		    
		    if(maximum_no_of_bottles_filled > no_of_bottles)
		    {
		        Console.WriteLine(no_of_bottles);
		    }
		    else
		    {
		        Console.WriteLine(maximum_no_of_bottles_filled);
		    }
		}
	}
}
